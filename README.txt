Drupal Facebook Like Button module:
------------------------
Requires - Drupal 7
License - GPL (see LICENSE)

Overview:
--------
Rather than having to manually copy/paste the "Like this on Facebook" code for
each piece of content you (or your users) create, this module will automatically
add that code to the end of each chosen node type. You are able to add a Like
button which likes a given URL (static, e.g. your homepage) or/and put a dynamic
Like button on your page to like the page you are actually visiting.

Features:
---------

The Facebook like button module:

* Adds a like button on your site (static)
* Add more like buttons to your site (dynamic)
* Control the position of the buttons
* Integrates with display suite.

Installation:
------------

Configuration:
-------------
Go to "Configuration" -> "FB LIKE BUTTON" to find
all the configuration options.

Contributions:

Display Suite Integration:
-------------------------
When using display suite to display the node's content the normal facebook like
button configuration settings for the dynamic facebook like button become
somewhat irrelevant.
