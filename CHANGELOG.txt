#1570374 by jgtrescazes, Stakcreativa: Fixes the display issue caused by the iframe having 'px' string after the width and height values. Also makes the language parameter optional.
#1664410 by lliss: Fixed the display failure of the fb button by changing the show_faces options that are stored as drupal variables to booleans and then outputting 'true' and 'false' text when generating the ifrome.
